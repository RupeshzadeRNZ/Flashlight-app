This repository contains the Android Flashlight App project developed using Kotlin during my internship program. 
The app allows users to utilize their device's camera LED as a flashlight with a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Features:
- Turn on/off the flashlight with a single tap.
- Minimal and user-friendly UI for easy interaction.
- Supports devices with a camera LED.


## Usage:
- Launch the Flashlight App on your Android device.
- You'll see a On/Off button on the main screen.
- Tap the On/Off button to turn on/off the flashlight.
- Enjoy the bright light of your device's camera LED!
